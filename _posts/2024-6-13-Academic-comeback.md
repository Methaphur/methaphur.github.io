title : "From Failure to Resilience : My Journey in Mathematics"
---

In my third semester, my first as a mathematics major, I encountered a profound setback. I failed a core course, which was devastating. Adding to my woes, I received grades of 4 in my other two math courses, barely scraping by. This period marked the lowest point in my academic journey. The consequences were severe: I lost my scholarship grant and my mentorship grant. The third semester was a cascade of losses, and I was forced to confront a harsh reality- I had not put in the necessary effort, and I paid the price.


Reflecting on that time, I felt like a loser and an idiot. I had succumbed to distractions and failed to prioritize my studies. The realization was painful but necessary. I knew that if I continued on this path, my dreams of succeeding in mathematics would slip further out of reach.


Determined to turn things around, I entered my fourth semester with a renewed sense of purpose. This time, I was committed to working hard and eliminating distractions. I chose to focus on myself and my studies, often spending long hours alone, immersed in my coursework. This isolation was not a retreat from the world but a strategic move to establish boundaries and maintain focus.


The results were not a "massive" success, but they were a significant improvement. I did not fail any courses, a testament to my hard work and newfound discipline. More importantly, I learned how to study effectively, developing strategies that would serve me well in future semesters.


This transformation would not have been possible without the unwavering support and motivation from my friends and family. You all stood by me, encouraging me when I felt like giving up. Your belief in my potential was a constant source of inspiration, and for that, I am profoundly grateful.


In conclusion, my journey from failure to resilience was marked by hard work, self-discipline, and the invaluable support of my friends. This experience taught me the importance of setting boundaries, focusing on my goals, and the power of perseverance. While the fourth semester was not the end of my struggles, it was a pivotal step in my academic and personal growth. Thank you to everyone who believed in me and supported me through this challenging time.
