Recently, I came across several Reddit posts about the film **Aavesham(2024)** by Jithu Madhavan. The film, starring Fahadh Faasil as the gangster Ranga, has sparked debate among viewers regarding its portrayal of themes such as alcoholism and smoking, with some suggesting it may have a negative influence on students. However, a deeper analysis reveals that the film actually critiques these behaviors and offers a broader, more meaningful narrative.

## Viewer Criticism


A significant portion of the audience has expressed discomfort with scenes involving excessive alcohol consumption and smoking, viewing them as glorified and overemphasized. Additionally, there is a particular scene where Ranga locks the teen protagonists in a room with prostitutes, which some viewers found distasteful and inappropriate. Here, I would like to convey four points of discussion and analysis:


1. **Dark Humor and Satire:**

   *Aavesham* uses dark humor and satire to critique rather than glorify the lifestyles it portrays, particularly regarding alcoholism and smoking. The over-the-top depiction of these behaviors is not meant to be taken at face value but rather to highlight the negative consequences of these behaviors. Such exaggeration serves to critique, not endorse, such lifestyles. We as viewers have to reflect on the implications beyond surface-level entertainment. The film prompts discussion about societal norms and personal responsibility. The teenage characters could very well be one of us or maybe our past selves in our college lives. Such controversial themes are surely a moment for introspection.

2. **Character Flaws and Development:**

   The film’s character Ranga is intricately woven with significant flaws that underscore a deeper narrative about human frailty and societal detachment. His portrayal goes beyond mere a gangster, instead exploring a profound misunderstanding of happiness and emotional fulfillment. Ranga’s misunderstanding of happiness and human emotions is a critical part of the narrative. The scenes where he provides sex workers to the students show his flawed perception and detachment from societal norms.

   Ranga's complexity is further highlighted by his mixed feelings about himself. Despite his power and wealth, he lacks genuine companionship and seeks true friendship. He finds it difficult to find true friendship amidst superficial admirers who follow him for his money and booze. His vulnerability, especially in the pivotal scene where he breaks down in tears, exposes his inner turmoil and longing for authentic connection. The betrayal by the three teens, whom he saw as genuine friends, deeply wounds him.

3. **The True Theme:**

   The central theme of *Aavesham* is about the protagonists' journey and their efforts to "charge up" (Aavesham in Malayalam) or energize themselves to confront their bullies. The title itself signifies a drive and determination to overcome challenges. The movie focuses on how the characters navigate through their problems, and how quickly the situation escalates into something they cannot control.

4. **Subtle Messaging Against Negative Behaviors:**

   Throughout the film, there are subtle yet clear messages against the very behaviors that some viewers criticize. For example, scenes where the students refuse alcohol when offered by their hostel mates in the second half of the film and gradually reduce smoking. This deliberate portrayal underscores the film's stance against alcoholism and smoking, showcasing them not as glamorous but as detrimental to academic performance and personal well-being. The negative consequences of alcohol are starkly depicted and align with the film's intent to critique, not endorse.

## Conclusion

*Aavesham* is a complex film that uses dark humor and exaggerated scenarios to deliver a critical message about negative behaviors such as excessive alcohol consumption and smoking. While some viewers might initially perceive these themes as glorified, a closer look reveals that the film is, in fact, a critique of these lifestyles. The narrative focuses on the characters' journey and the consequences of their actions, ultimately delivering a message against the very behaviors it seemingly portrays. By understanding the film’s deeper themes and satirical elements, viewers can appreciate the nuanced storytelling and the critical perspective it offers.
